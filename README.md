## Summary

This website is designed using a purely React + CSS front end along with a form created using the React-Bootstrap framework. The intention with this website was to provide a very smooth and interactive experience for endusers to promote the beauty of the products that Feather & Fern Paper Co. creates. The page can adapt to screen sizes as large as a 27" monitor down to a mobile phone size seamlessly. The app is deployed using Heroku.

The gallery page, while still under development, utilizes an AWS S3 database where gallery photos are easily uploaded and retrieved to be displayed on the website. The goal is to ultimately make it easy for the business to easily upload new galleries for viewing through a portal they can log into.

This project was meant to challenge my abilities in creating a functioning multi-page website with multiple features including a form that automaticlaly sends emails, a database integration, unique interactive style elements, and responsive design. I ran into some challenges with formatting for the form page that I solved with using flex elements and flex-grid and used media queries to adapt style according to screen size. The largest topic of learning for me has been learning baout hte AWS S3 product and integrating data from an S3 bucket into the gallery page. I was able to connect to the S3 bucket using my local version of the website by making the bucket public and using the boto3 framework.

Next steps in this project include displaying current gallery photos retrieved from the S3 bucket onto the deployed Heroku site and then creating a portal for gallery photo upload.
